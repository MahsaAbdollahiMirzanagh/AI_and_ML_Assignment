# AI_and_ML_Assignment
## Overview
This README provides details about an assignment focusing on AI and machine learning concepts. The assignment aims to apply machine learning algorithms to a dataset and evaluate their performance.

## Dataset
The assignment utilizes a dataset, the specifics of which will be provided. This dataset serves as the foundation for implementing and testing various machine learning models.

## Models Implemented
We'll be implementing several machine learning models as part of this assignment. These models will include regression, classification, or clustering algorithms, depending on the assignment requirements.

## Evaluation Metrics
To assess the effectiveness of the implemented models, we'll use evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, or F1 score. These metrics will help us understand how well the models perform on the given dataset.

## Instructions
To run the code and reproduce the results:

## Clone the repository to your local machine.
Install the required dependencies as specified in the README or setup instructions.
Run the provided code files using your preferred Python environment or IDE.
Explore the results and evaluate the performance of the implemented models.

## Results
The results of running the code will be presented in the assignment report. This report will include visualizations, tables, or summaries showcasing the performance of the models and their comparison.

## Conclusion
The assignment conclusion will provide insights into the strengths, limitations, and potential improvements of the implemented models. It will also offer reflections on the assignment process and outcomes.
